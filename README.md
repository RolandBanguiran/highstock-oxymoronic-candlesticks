Highstock Oxymoronic Candlesticks
=================================

Using this plugin will enable "Oxymoronic" candlesticks. Candles that are colored bullishly, but filled bearishly (i.e., a filled, green candle) or vice versa (i.e., a hollow red candle).

To disable, set oxymoronic = false. Default is true.
