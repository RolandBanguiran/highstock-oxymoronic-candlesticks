# Highstock "Oxymoronic" Candlesticks
Using this plugin will enable "Oxymoronic" candlesticks. Candles that are colored bullishly, but filled bearishly (i.e., a filled, green candle) or vice versa (i.e., a hollow red candle).

To disable, set oxymoronic = false. Default is true.
```javascript
plotOptions: {
    candlestick: {
        oxymoronic: false
    }
}
```
